Let's start.

This assumes your target disk is /dev/sda, you are running UEFI, you want rEFInd because it's cool, you are wired into ethernet for the install process, you use US keyboard, and mostly understand english

Create partitions:

cgdisk /dev/sda

	/dev/sda1 /boot 100M
	/dev/sda2 /     20G
	/dev/sda3 swap  "Amount of Ram" 
	/dev/sda4 /home "Remaining space" 

Format stuff: 

mkfs.vfat -F 32 /dev/sda1
mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda2
mkwap /dev/sda3
mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda4

Mount stuff: 

mount /dev/sda2 /mnt
mkdir /mnt/boot
mkdir /mnt/home
mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/boot
mount /dev/sda4 /mnt/home

Install stuff: 

pacstrap -i /mnt base base-devel refind-efi xorg-server xf86-video-intel xf86-video-nouveau xf86-video-ati xf86-video-amdgpu gnome gdm firefox networkmanager network-manager-applet htop zsg grml-zsh-config

Put into fstab some stuff: 

genfstab -U /mnt >> /mnt/etc/fstab 

Chroot into stuff:

arch-chroot /mnt /bin/zsh

Install bootloader stuff: 

refind-install 

Shells, users, permissions, all that stuff:

passwd

chsh /bin/zsh

useradd -m -G wheel -s /bin/zsh user
passwd user

Hostname stuff:

echo arch > /etc/hostname

Locale stuff: 

echo en_US.UTF-8 > /etc/locale.gen
echo LANG=en_US.UTF-8 > /etc/locale.conf
ln -s /usr/share/zoneinfo/Europe/Berlin /etc/localtime

Enable some stuff:

systemctl enable NetworkManager
systemctl enable gdm

Get out to actually do stuff:

exit
reboot
